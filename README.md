# Music Library API

## About

The Music libraby API project as part of the Manchester Codes curriculum (back-end module).

The project implements RESTful routes and allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on artist and albums in a MySQL database.

The project was built with Node and Express and uses SQL to interact with the database.

Test Driven Development was used throughout the project with Mocha, Chia and Supertest used for itergation testing.
